# Full-Stack Developer Trial Task – Customer Portal MVP

## **Objective**

Build a functional proof-of-concept (POC) for a minimal **Customer Portal**.
The solution must demonstrate competence with **Next.js**, **Express.js**, and integration with at least **one real ServiceM8 API endpoint**.

This exercise evaluates your ability to:

* Interpret requirements independently
* Make reasonable assumptions
* Deliver working functionality within a strict time limit

---

## **Functional Requirements**

The delivered POC must enable a customer to:

* **Log in** using email and phone number (or comparable identifiers)
* **View a list of their bookings**
* **Access details of a specific booking**
* **View associated file attachments**
* **Send messages** related to a booking, persisted in the backend

---

## **Technical Requirements**

* Frontend must be implemented using **Next.js**
* Backend must be implemented using **Express.js**
* At least **one real ServiceM8 API call** is required
* Additional integrations may be **mocked where appropriate**
* Data persistence method is at your discretion
* User interface design may be minimal; **functionality is prioritized**

---

## **Assumptions and Autonomy**

You may:

* Make **reasonable assumptions** where necessary
* Use **AI-assisted tools** to support development

No additional guidance will be provided once the task begins.

---

## **Deliverables**

Submit the following upon completion:

1. **A working deployment link** or **local setup instructions**
2. **Full source code** for both frontend and backend
3. A **TECH_NOTES.md** containing:

   * What was built
   * Reasoning behind your approach
   * Assumptions made
   * Potential improvements
   * How AI assisted your workflow
4. Any **setup instructions** required to run the project

---

## **Evaluation Criteria**

Candidates will be assessed on:

* Implementation quality in **Next.js**, **Express.js**, and API integrations
* Architectural decisions, clarity of design, and organization
* Ability to interpret requirements and work independently
* Effective use of **AI as a development accelerator**
* Quantity and quality of deliverables produced within the time limit

---

This brief is designed to evaluate **real-world problem-solving ability**, **technical competence**, and **productivity under constrained conditions**.
